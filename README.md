LAB 3:
Create a java program that performs the following operation:
The program should collect an integer array from the user
After the array is entered, you need to create a menu of items

Find the Mean Value
Find the Median Value
Find the Mode Value
From the user-given array.

The program should have a minimum of 3 functions apart from the main function; each of the functions implements the Mean, Median, and Mode computation by accepting the array user has entered as a parameter and returning the value as a result. From the main method, you will display the result.
=======
Lab2 :
You are supposed to create a menu-driven program that has the following menu options:
 Enter a name
 Search for a name
 Remove a name
 Show all names

Note:
The menu-driven program has to be made with the help of a do-while loop and switch-case statements.

Constraints:
 The names collected must be stored in an array with a max length of 1024.
 The names in the array should be UNIQUE; no duplicate entries are expected!
 Provide necessary validations that the user enters only valid names that are not going to be repeated.
 Removing a name should not create empty space inside the array!
 Format your results properly!!
